# Call Center Trends
Developed an interactive dashboard in Power BI to visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics for a call center, aimed at enhancing operational efficiency and customer satisfaction. 
The dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of call center performance, enabling data-driven decision-making and strategic improvements.
### Project Overview
#### Overall Customer Satisfaction: Visualized average customer satisfaction scores, segmented by various dimensions such as time, agent, and call type.
Overall Calls Answered/Abandoned: Displayed metrics on the total number of calls answered and abandoned, with trends over time.
Calls by Time: Analyzed call volume patterns, identifying peak hours and trends across different time periods.
Average Speed of Answer: Tracked the average time taken to answer calls, helping to assess and improve response times.
Agentâ€™s Performance Quadrant: Evaluated agent performance using a quadrant chart that plots average handle time (talk duration) against the number of calls answered, highlighting top performers and areas for improvement

### Tools
#### Power BI: Data visualization, analysis, and dashboard creation.
#### DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Created calculated measures to derive new metrics and perform complex calculations within Power BI.
